usage: recrepo.py [-h] [--ignore-dirty] [--output OUTPUT]
                  pointer [pointer ...]

Record repository status after asserting it's clean.

This script records the status of one or more repositories in a JSON
file.  It also asserts that those repositories are clean (unless
``--ignore-dirty`` option is given) and exit with an error code if
files that are not tracked by git or not committed are found.

Examples
--------
::
    recrepo PATH/TO/GIT/REPOSITORY
    recrepo --output=repo.json PATH/TO/GIT/REPOSITORY
    recrepo REPOSITORY_1 REPOSITORY_2

positional arguments:
  pointer          Path to a file or directory inside a project. Multiple
                   paths can be given.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --ignore-dirty   Ignore repositories with un-committed files. By default,
                   un-committed files result in exit with return code 113.
