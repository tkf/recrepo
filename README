usage: recrepo [-h] [--ignore-dirty] [--output OUTPUT] [--version]
               pointer [pointer ...]

Record repository status after asserting it's clean.

This script records the status of one or more repositories in a JSON
file (``recrepo.json`` by default).  It also asserts that those
repositories are clean (unless ``--ignore-dirty`` option is given) and
exit with an error code if files that are not tracked by git or not
committed are found.

Examples
--------
::
    recrepo PATH/TO/GIT/REPOSITORY
    recrepo --output=- PATH/TO/GIT/REPOSITORY
    recrepo REPOSITORY_1 REPOSITORY_2

Installation

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkf/recrepo/master/recrepo.py -O recrepo

positional arguments:
  pointer          Path to a file or directory inside a project. Multiple

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --ignore-dirty   Ignore repositories with un-committed files. By default,
                   un-committed files result in exit with return code 113.

                   recrepo.json)
